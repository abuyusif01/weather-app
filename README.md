Project summary 
Weather predictions are created by gathering as much information as possible about the current state of the atmosphere (especially temperature, humidity, and wind) and using meteorology to predict how the environment will evolve in the future.
WEATHER_APP is a web-based/mobile application that allows you to access all weather forecasts information for any location. Its geographical identifier, which is acquired via your browser settings and server setup, will automatically identify the place and be able to display weather details such as temperature, wind direction, precipitation, humidity, and so on.

Objectives
- Assists people in planning outdoor activities (e.g., determining whether rain, storms, or cold weather will affect an outdoor event).
- Helps users in deciding whether or not to bring extra clothing in case of inclement weather.
- Assists businesses and individuals in preparing for severe weather and other weather-related threats (lightning, hail, tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms).
- Aims to assist farmers and gardeners in creating irrigation and crop security plans.
